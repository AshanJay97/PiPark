Welcome to PiPark setup, here's a quick run-through of the steps to successfully setup your PiPark unit.
            
1) After appropriately mounting the PiPark unit its positioning may need to be fine-tuned. To do this, click on 'Take New Setup Image', which will give a full-screen display of the unit's image feed. Once the positioning of the unit has been finalised a setup image must be taken by pressing the ENTER key whilst the image feed is still being displayed.
     
2) Next the parking spaces need to be marked onto the setup image. To do this click on 'Add/Remove Spaces'. To mark a space, two clicks on the image is required to mark rectangles denoting the location and size of the space. For the best result the rectangle must be smaller than the bounding lines of the parking space.

Afterwards, three control points (CPs) need to be set. This can be done by clicking on 'Add/Remove Control Points' and performing single clicks on the setup image. Three control points are required for setup to be completed, and they should be set to a part of the car park that is not a parking space.

To remove a parking space or CP, hold the control key (CTRL) and click on the space or CP.

4) The final step to completing the setup is to register the car park with the server. This can only be completed after three CPs and at least one space has been marked. 

Now the setup is complete. To run the main PiPark software click on 'Start PiPark' or click on 'Quit' and then double-click the PiPark main program on the desktop.
